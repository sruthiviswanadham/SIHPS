## Name: viswanadham venkata sai sruthi
## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases
## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea

The idea revolves around establishing a network of community-based e-waste recycling hubs that focus on local collection, repair, and recycling of electronic waste. These hubs would be strategically located in urban and rural areas to maximize accessibility and encourage community involvement in e-waste management. The hubs would serve as one-stop centers for drop-off, education, and small-scale recycling activities, contributing to a circular economy.

## Technology Stack

Creating an effective technology stack for e-waste management involves integrating various technologies that support the collection, tracking, processing, and recycling of electronic waste. Below is an overview of a typical technology stack for e-waste management:
1. Cybersecurity Solutions
Purpose: To protect the data collected and processed in the e-waste management system, robust cybersecurity measures are essential. This includes securing IoT devices, cloud platforms, and any blockchain implementations.
Examples: Firewalls, encryption, and security monitoring tools like Splunk or Palo Alto Networks.
2. Recycling and Material Recovery Technologies
Purpose: These include advanced machinery and processes for the disassembly, shredding, and extraction of valuable materials from e-waste. Innovations in this area focus on improving recovery rates and reducing environmental impact.
Examples: Automated disassembly lines, chemical extraction processes for precious metals, and shredding systems designed for electronic waste.
3. Mobile and Web Applications
Purpose: Mobile apps and web portals allow consumers and businesses to easily locate e-waste collection points, schedule pickups, and track the status of their e-waste. They can also be used for educational purposes, raising awareness about proper e-waste disposal.
Examples: Custom apps for scheduling pickups, tracking e-waste disposal, or reporting illegal dumping.
4. Cloud Computing
Purpose: Cloud platforms provide the infrastructure for data storage, processing, and analytics. Cloud computing enables scalable and secure management of large datasets generated by IoT sensors and other systems.
Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud can host applications, databases, and analytics platforms for e-waste management.

## Dependencies

Dependencies in e-waste management refer to the various factors, systems, and stakeholders that are essential for the successful implementation and operation of an e-waste management program. These dependencies ensure that the entire process, from collection to recycling or disposal, is efficient, compliant with regulations, and environmentally sustainable
Environmental and Health Considerations :
Importance: Proper handling of hazardous materials in e-waste, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, is critical to protect the environment and public health. Failure to manage these substances properly can result in serious environmental contamination and health risks.
Dependencies: Access to safe recycling technologies, strict adherence to environmental standards, and continuous monitoring of environmental impact.
